[SCENE: Landing page]

Every home sale in America requires a title search. A human examiner manually navigates county recorder websites, looking up deeds, liens, and ownership history. It takes 5 to 14 days. Costs 300 to 600 dollars. For every single transaction.

The problem isn't technology. It's that all 3,600 counties in America have different websites, different interfaces, different data formats. There's no API. The only way in — is a web browser.

That's exactly what Amazon Nova Act was built for.

[SCENE: Search page — type address, click Run Analysis]

Title AI deploys Nova Act browser agents to automate title searches in real time. Enter any property address, and our multi-agent pipeline goes to work.

[SCENE: Terminal showing agent progress, screenshots appearing]

Watch this. The system identifies the county, locates the correct recorder website, and deploys a Nova Act agent. The agent opens a cloud-hosted browser, navigates the county's search portal, enters the property address, and extracts deed records — live.

You can see the actual browser screenshots from Nova Act as it works through the county recorder site. This isn't a simulation. This is a real browser, on a real government website, controlled by AI.

[SCENE: Results page — chain of title, liens, risk assessment]

Within seconds, you get a complete title report. The chain of title shows every ownership transfer — grantor, grantee, document type, recording date. The lien scan identifies tax liens, mortgages, HOA liens, and judgments. And Nova Pro generates a risk assessment, flagging title exceptions and potential issues.

You can also interact through natural language. Ask the AI to run searches, explain title insurance concepts, or review past results. Nova Pro's tool-calling capability drives the entire conversation.

[SCENE: Architecture / closing]

Under the hood: Nova Act handles the browser automation across 50-plus counties. Nova Pro on Amazon Bedrock powers the analysis, risk assessment, and report generation. The system covers Texas, California, Florida, New York, and 10 more states — with verified recorder URLs for every county.

Title AI. Weeks of manual work, replaced by seconds of AI. Built with Amazon Nova Act and Nova Pro.
