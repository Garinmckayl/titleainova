# Title AI — Video Script & Narration (Final)

**ElevenLabs** | Voice: Adam | Model: Turbo v2.5 | Speed: 0.95x
**Target length: 2:45 – 3:00**
**Category tag in video: #AmazonNova**

Rule: The first 30 seconds must show Nova Act navigating a real government website. That's the differentiator no one else has. Lead with the browser. Everything else is proof.

---

## SHOT 1 — The Hook (0:00 – 0:30) · 30s

**WHAT TO SHOW:**
Open directly on the live browser view — Nova Act already navigating a county recorder website. The agent is mid-session: you can see it typing into the search form, hitting search, records appearing. Screenshots streaming in the UI panel on the right. Don't start from the address input. Start in the middle of the most impressive thing: a real AI browser session on a real US government site.

**OVERLAY — top left, large, appears at 0:02:**
```
Title AI
A real AI browser. A real government site.
Searching property records — live.
```

**OVERLAY — bottom center, appears at 0:15:**
```
Amazon Nova Act — not a simulation
```

**NARRATION:**
> "What you're watching is Amazon Nova Act
> navigating a real US county recorder website —
> a live government database —
> searching property records autonomously.
> No API. No scraper. A real browser, controlled by AI.
> This is not a simulation. This is not cached data.
> This is happening right now."

## SHOT 2 — The Problem (0:30 – 0:48) · 18s

**WHAT TO SHOW:**
Cut to a full-screen text card. Black background, white text. No UI. Let the numbers hit.

**OVERLAY — center screen, large:**
```
3,600 counties in America.
Zero standardized APIs.
5–14 days per title search.
$300–$600 per transaction.
Every. Single. Time.
```

**NARRATION:**
> "Real estate title search is one of the last manual bottlenecks in a trillion-dollar industry.
> Three thousand six hundred counties. No API. No standard.
> The only way into the data is a web browser —
> different forms, different layouts, different everything.
> Until now, the only solution was a human examiner and two weeks.
> Nova Act changes that."

## SHOT 3 — Run a Search (0:48 – 1:15) · 27s

**WHAT TO SHOW:**
Cut to the Title AI search page. Type a real property address — something in Texas or California. Hit **Run Analysis**. The pipeline activates:

- County Lookup resolves instantly
- Nova Act deploys — show the live browser thumbnail appearing
- Screenshots start streaming into the panel, one by one
- Show the agent typing into the county recorder's search box on the live site

**OVERLAY — when county resolves:**
```
County identified → Harris County, TX
Verified recorder URL loaded
```

**OVERLAY — when browser thumbnail appears:**
```
Nova Act — cloud Chromium session active
AgentCore Browser Tool
```

**OVERLAY — as screenshots stream:**
```
Screenshots streaming live from Nova Act
Real government website · Real records
```

**NARRATION:**
> "Enter any property address.
> The system identifies the county, loads the verified recorder URL,
> and Nova Act deploys a cloud browser session via AgentCore.
> Watch the screenshots streaming on the right —
> that's Nova Act typing the address into the county's search portal,
> hitting search, and extracting deed records.
> On the actual site. In real time."

## SHOT 4 — The Analysis Pipeline (1:15 – 1:50) · 35s

**WHAT TO SHOW:**
The browser session completes. Cut to the results page appearing — watch it build section by section:

1. **Chain of Title** panel fills in — names, dates, document types scrolling
2. **Lien Detection** panel — show a tax lien appearing with claimant and amount
3. **Risk Assessment** — severity flags appearing (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW)
4. **PDF download button** appears

Scroll through the results slowly. Let the depth show.

**OVERLAY — as chain of title fills:**
```
Chain of Title — Nova Pro
Every ownership transfer. Grantor. Grantee. Date. Instrument.
```

**OVERLAY — as lien detection runs:**
```
Lien Detection — Nova Pro
Tax liens · Mortgages · HOA · Judgments
```

**OVERLAY — as risk flags appear:**
```
Risk Assessment — Nova Pro
Title exceptions classified by severity
```

**NARRATION:**
> "Nova Act returns the raw deed records.
> Then three Nova Pro agents run in parallel —
> Chain of Title extracts every ownership transfer, fully structured.
> Lien Detection identifies every encumbrance — tax liens, mortgages, HOA, judgments.
> Risk Assessment classifies title exceptions by severity and flags what needs attention.
> Every output is structured JSON — not a summary, not free text.
> Data that feeds directly into a title commitment report."

## SHOT 5 — PDF Report (1:50 – 2:05) · 15s

**WHAT TO SHOW:**
Click the PDF download. Show the branded Title Commitment Report opening — formatted, professional, with the chain of title, lien table, risk flags, and executive summary all visible.

**OVERLAY — bottom center:**
```
Full Title Commitment Report — PDF
Chain of title · Liens · Risk assessment · Executive summary
```

**NARRATION:**
> "One click — a complete, branded Title Commitment Report.
> Chain of title, lien schedule, risk flags, executive summary.
> The same document a title examiner produces manually in two weeks.
> Generated in minutes."

---

## SHOT 6 — Chat with Tool Calling (2:05 – 2:20) · 15s

**WHAT TO SHOW:**
Switch to the Chat page. Type: **"Run a title search on 123 Main Street, Austin TX and tell me if there are any liens."** Nova Pro calls the `run_title_search` tool, the pipeline executes, and the answer comes back with the lien results inline in the conversation.

**OVERLAY — bottom center:**
```
Nova Pro tool calling — run_title_search
Natural language → full title pipeline
```

**NARRATION:**
> "Or just ask.
> Nova Pro's tool-calling capability runs the entire pipeline
> from a natural language request.
> No forms. No clicks. Just a question and a result."

---

## SHOT 6b — PWA Install (2:18 – 2:26) · 8s

**WHAT TO SHOW:**
On mobile (or Chrome desktop), show the browser install prompt for Title AI. Accept it. Show the "Title AI" icon with the blue T landing on the home screen. Tap it — launches full-screen, no browser chrome.

**OVERLAY — bottom center:**
```
Installable PWA — runs like a native app
Title searches from your home screen
```

**NARRATION:**
> "It installs as a native app.
> A real estate agent runs a title search from their phone
> before they even leave the property."

---

## SHOT 7 — Closing (2:26 – 2:56) · 30s

**WHAT TO SHOW:**
Show the architecture diagram for 5 seconds — clean, shows Nova Act + Nova Pro + AgentCore + Bedrock. Then cut to a final full-screen text card.

**OVERLAY — architecture diagram:**
```
Nova Act · AgentCore Browser Tool · Nova Pro · Amazon Bedrock
65+ counties · 14 states · Live government data
```

**OVERLAY — final card, center, large:**
```
5–14 days → minutes
$600 per search → automated
3,600 counties. One platform.
```

Fade to:
```
Title AI
Built with Amazon Nova Act + Nova Pro
Real browsers. Real records. Real results.
#AmazonNova
```

**NARRATION:**
> "Nova Act across 65-plus counties in 14 states.
> Nova Pro for chain of title, lien detection, risk assessment, and reporting.
> All on Amazon Bedrock.
>
> Five to fourteen days — replaced by minutes.
> Six hundred dollars per search — automated.
> The last manual bottleneck in real estate title,
> solved by the one technology that could actually do it —
> a real AI browser on real government websites.
>
> Title AI. Built with Amazon Nova Act and Nova Pro."

## Recording Notes

- **Shot 1 is everything.** Pre-stage a Nova Act session that's already mid-navigation before you hit record. Open on the live browser view — the agent already typing into the county recorder site. Judges see a real government website being automated by AI in the first 3 seconds. Nothing else in 10,000 submissions looks like this.
- **Shot 2 — no UI.** Black screen, white numbers only. The visual contrast after a busy browser screenshot makes the numbers hit.
- **Shot 4 — go slow on the results.** Each section of the results page should be on screen for at least 3 seconds. This is your technical proof — don't rush it.
- **Shot 5 — show the PDF at a readable zoom.** If judges can actually read the chain of title entries in the PDF, it's more convincing than a blurry document thumbnail.
- **The word "simulation" in Shot 1 narration is intentional.** Say it explicitly. Judges are used to seeing mocked demos — preemptively killing that doubt is worth two seconds of narration.
- **Overlay style:** White text, dark pill `rgba(0,0,0,0.7)`, `border-radius: 8px`. Text cards (Shots 2, 7): full-screen `#0a0a0a` background, centered white text, no pill.
